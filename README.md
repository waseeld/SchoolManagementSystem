## 📘 Project Overview
The **School Management System (SMS)** is a simple console-based Java application designed to manage a school's daily activities.  
It can store and display information about students, teachers, departments, classrooms, labs, buses, and more.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as:
- Classes and Objects  
- Inheritance  
- Abstraction  
- Composition and Aggregation  
- Association  

---

## 🧩 System Features (Planned)
- Manage school details (name, address, contact info)
- Add and view students and employees
- Manage classes, labs, and departments
- Bus details and seating info
- Notice board and event announcements
- Basic CLI (Command Line Interface) menu for navigation

- Test compilation (no full logic yet).

### **Phase 2 (Week 3) – Integration**
- Add CLI user interface (`Main.java`).
- Implement logic and connect all classes.
- Test all features.
